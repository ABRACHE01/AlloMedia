# Cloning and Running the AlloMedia Repo

In this README, we'll guide you through the process of cloning the AlloMedia repository, which is an application for delivery services. We'll also show you how to set it up and run the server and the database. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Git:** [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- **Node.js [>16] and npm:** [Install Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)

## Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the AlloMedia Express repository. You can do this using the `cd` command. For example, to clone it into your home directory, you can use:
 `https://github.com/medabra/AlloMedia.git`
2. Navigate inside the project by implementing this command `cd alloMedia`

## Install Dependencies

- Now that you're inside the project directory, you need to install the project dependencies. Run the following command: 
`npm install`   
- This command will download and install all the necessary Node.js modules and packages specified in the package.json file.

- ## Running the Server and Database

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the server by running the following command: `npm start`  

This will start the AlloMedia Express application, and you should see output indicating that the server is running.

Your database might also need to be started or configured separately, depending on the project's setup. Please check the project's documentation or README for specific instructions on setting up and running the database.

That's it! You've successfully cloned the AlloMedia Express repository, installed the necessary dependencies, and started the server. You can now access and interact with the application by opening a web browser and navigating to the appropriate address (e.g., [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)). Enjoy using the AlloMedia delivery service application!
